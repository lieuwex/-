{}, pronounced as: "Two squirrely brackets, where one is facing its squirrely endings to the right (east, you know where the sun goes up) and the other one facing its squirrely endings to the left (west, where the sun goes under).", is a new language using the ideas of scoping extensively. This on its own should make you want to use {} already, I mean, it's the best functional language ever made. Look at the [language reference](./Reference.md) to see how amazing it is!
